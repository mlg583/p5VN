N: This is NYU-Chan.



N: NYU-Chan is an IDM student at Tandon, and as you know, it's finals season.
N: Naturally, one would think to make their finals go as smooth as possible.

N: But NYU-Chan goes to Tandon.
$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 3)
N: And Tandon students seem to like pain.

NYU-Chan: I had a fantastic idea for my Creative Coding final!
 
N: Oh no.  

$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 2)

NYU-Chan: I made my very own visual novel engine!

$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 1)
NYU-Chan: I thought it'd be so much fun!

$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 3)


N: NYU-Chan thought it'd be fun to code a game engine from scratch in 3 weeks time.
N: ...despite her less than amazing programming skills.

N: What do you think viewer? Do you think a sane person would attempt to do a project like this?

$menu("JokeMenu", 2, "Yes", afterJokeMenu, "No", afterJokeMenu2a)

$tag(afterJokeMenu)
N: Oh whoops, sorry I think I loaded the wrong menu.
N: Try these choices. I think you'll find them more accurate.

N: I know right?

N: EXACTLY.

N: Anyways... let's walk through the creation of the engine.

$hide("NYU-Chan")
$bg(none)

N: NYU-Chan started with the basic layout of the Visual Novel engine.
N: She needed a text box, so using p5.scribble.js, she made one. Like this:
N:
N: Cool huh?
NYU-Chan: Yeah! Then I made a whole parser.
NYU-Chan: You can't see most of that work... but it's the reason you're reading all of this!

N: That sounds like it was completely beyond the scope of this class!

NYU-Chan: Yup! :D

N: So what did you do next?

$show("NYU-Chan", CENTER)
$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 2)
$bg(Empty)
NYU-Chan: Images!

NYU-Chan: Making me and anyone else show up was hard...

$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 4)
NYU-Chan: So hard...

N: How so?
$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 1)

NYU-Chan: Well... the script you're reading right now was input via a text file and processed into engine instructions.

N: Go on.

NYU-Chan: But because images are handled and loaded dynamically in the script, they can't be preloaded. And that causes problems.
$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 4)
NYU-Chan: Why must Javascript be asynchronous.

N: Oof.
$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 1)
NYU-Chan: But Hey...&show(RIGHT)
NYU-Chan: Now I can do this!
$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 2)

$show("Barry", LEFT)
Barry: Ya like jazz?

N: Why is Barry from The Bee Movie on the screen?

$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 1)
NYU-Chan: The Bee Movie script was orignally what I used to implement the scripting language for this engine, and Barry's images are still in the files.
NYU-Chan: Do you like The Bee Movie?
$menu("BeeMenu", 2, "Yes", yesMovie, "No", noMovie)

$tag(yesMovie)
$setVar(movieFlag, true)
$jump(afterMovie)

$tag(noMovie)
$setVar(movieFlag, false)
$jump(afterMovie)

$tag(afterMovie)

N: Let's see what you think player. I'll test the engine's variable features.

$if(movieFlag, yesResponse, noResponse)

$tag(yesResponse)
N: ...
N: You really like that trash?
N: How cultured.
$jump(afterResponse)

$tag(noResponse)
N: ...
N: Hey look at you, you don't have bad taste.
$jump(afterResponse)

$tag(afterResponse)
N: Okay then, bye Barry!
$hide("Barry")

N: So what's so great about this engine, NYU-Chan?

$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 2)
NYU-Chan: Well... it's really easy to use!&show(CENTER)

$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 1)

NYU-Chan: Dialogue is written out like a movie script! And all of the functions start with a $! And even better it is completely controled via a single text file. 
$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 2)
NYU-Chan: Refer to the documentation for a list of all of the commands and how they work! With a single file, you can create an entire story-driven game!
$setSprite("NYU-Chan", 1)
NYU-Chan: Right now, the script your are reading, has tested out all of the current functionality of this engine. While it's still simple, it's potentially very powerful!

N: You guys can download the source code on Github, feel free to experiment with it on your own!
